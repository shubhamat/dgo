I created a simple test to verify that load balancing does happen as more cows join the herd.  

SETUP:
4 Raspberry PI 3's  (named samnode[1-4])  running Hypriotos  and 1 HP ENVY Laptop (names saminux).  All on same WiFi network.

PROCEDURE:

Step 1:  Created a GOB file   by  running `./cow --sow-of=a.gob --max-work-duration=5 --work-items=100`
    Note: 100 is the default number of work items, so --work-items flag is optional for this case.
    
Step  2:   Ran a cow on samnode1  : './cow --eat-if=a.go'   Since default iface is wlan0 --iface option was not give.  cow exited once the work queue got empty. Noted
the time it took for this cow to process everything in its work queue.

Step 3,4,5,6: Ran cow's on samnode[2-4] and saminux  and launched the cow on samnode1.  Took note of processing time for each of the cases.  samnode1's cow was launched
last to ensure that all cows are in the herd before the load is made available.
