This is the second test where two cows have load added to their work queues through gob files. More cows are added to see how well the load balances. 

SETUP:
4 Raspberry PI 3's  (named samnode[1-4])  running Hypriotos  and 1 HP ENVY Laptop (names saminux).  All on same WiFi network.

PROCEDURE:

Step 1: Created two load (.gob) files with following parameters:
a.gob : work-items = 100, max-duration = 5
b.gob : work-items = 50,  max-duration = 10
    
Step 2: Ran a cow on samnode1 samnode1$ './cow --eat-if=a.go'.  Recorded the data generated by report.

Step 3: Ran a cow on samnode2 samnode2$ './cow --eat-if=b.go'.  Recorded the data generated by report.

Step 4: Ran cow's on samnode3, samnode4 and saminux.  Note: Each run of the test added 1 cow

Step 5: Ran a cow on samnode2 as per Step 2.

Step 6: Ran a cow on samnode1 as per Step 1.

Step 7: Wait for cow's on samnode1 and samnode2 to exit after all the items in their queues have been processed.
