1. ABOUT

    hcrux is a utility that splits a file into multiple pieces and stores them on different nodes.
    To retrieve the file again, all the nodes should be online.  This would be useful as a mobile
    app where an important document is split across multiple devices and the same document is
    retrieved when each device is at a specified location and/or active during a given time window.
