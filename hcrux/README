1. ABOUT

    hcrux is a utility that splits a file into multiple pieces and stores them on different nodes.
    To retrieve the file again, all the nodes should be online.  This would be useful as a mobile
    app where an important document is split across multiple devices and the same document is
    retrieved when all the devices are in the same vicinity (determined through GPS or bluetooth).


2. ASSUMPTIONS

    1. Each node has a way of communicating with other nodes. A public IP or a bluetooth address.

3. ACTORS

    node: A node stores the individual pieces of a file. It has an IP address or other means of
          communicating with other nodes. A node should have a GPS or bluetooth device or wifi
          to determine proximity.
