The dgo repository contains all the sources for making dockerized go apps.

For server and client apps, launch them with --net=host.   The long term goal is to explore self-organizing algorithms.  We need a lightweight way of allowing containers
to talk to each other, hence the use of --net=host.

example on RPI3:

$ sudo docker run --rm  --net=host shubhamat/server_arm

$ sudo docker run --rm --net=host shubhamat/client_arm

TBD: The server address is hardcoded, make it readable through a flag.
